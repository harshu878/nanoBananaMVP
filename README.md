# nanoBananaMVP
Build a web app that lets users take a photo with their camera or upload an existing image, then uses nano banana to generate a full “AI photoshoot” for each selected outfit: around 10 high-quality images per outfit, across varied backgrounds and poses, so it looks like a professional lookbook rather than a single static try-on.
